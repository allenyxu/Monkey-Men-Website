## Our Theme

#### Our team, called MonkeyMen, wanted to create a pleasent, easy to use website to access all our projects. We created our portfolio in hopes of resembling that of nature, as we, the monkeys, often spend our time out there. From the bright stars at night to the morning sunrise over the trees, we hope that all these elements synergize together to create a website that gives you the feeling of being outside like monkeys.
